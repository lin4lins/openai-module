ITZY is a five-member girl group under JYP Entertainment. They debuted on February 12, 2019, with the digital single album "IT'z Different". Their official introduction is, "All in us! Hi, we are ITZY!".
Before their debut, the members had prior industry experience. Chaeryeong competed in "K-pop Star 3" (2013) and "SIXTEEN" (2015). Ryujin was on "MIXNINE" (2017-2018) and placed first for girls but lost to the boys' team. Yeji competed on "The Fan" and was eliminated in episode 5. All members, except Lia, appeared on "Stray Kids" in 2017 as a project group.
ITZY's early career saw rapid success with their debut single "Dalla Dalla," breaking records for the most-viewed K-pop debut music video in 24 hours. They released more hit tracks like "Icy" and "Wannabe," leading to successful tours in Asia and the US. The group quickly amassed a global fanbase, MIDZY, and had multiple brand deals.
On September 18, 2023, JYP Entertainment announced that Lia would be going on hiatus due to symptoms of extreme tension and anxiety. Due to this, she was absent from their new album's production in January 2024 and their world tour. Lia eventually resumed activities after 9 months."""
